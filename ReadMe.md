# Minimal implemetation of Random Network Distillation 
To run this notebook upload it on colab and directly run the cells. To run it locally you can use the uploaded yaml file to create conda env as follows:
```
conda create -f drl.yml
```

Note: Performance might vary due to different versions of llibrary installed in colab.


## Result
The video `pendulum.mp4` shows the trained policy using this codebase on colab.

## Acknowledgment
We build our codebase upon the PPO implementation by [https://github.com/seungeunrho/minimalRL](https://github.com/seungeunrho/minimalRL)
